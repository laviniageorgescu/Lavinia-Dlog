# Lavinia-Dlog
Daily logs for accountability. 

This is a GitRepo to keep track of daily short summaries submitted to journal.txt

The file is updated using [jrnl](https://jrnl.sh/) in command line (brew install for OSX not updated; pip has latest version). All updates will be made in the same text file. Commits signal change has been made (i.e. summary submitted), which signals PhD activities have been done and recorded for that day. 

-- updates to this file to follow (e.g. date format search, tags used and tag searching etc)
