[2020-01-20 19:43] First entry.
Outline drought indices. Ref annotations, structure for section.on. @writing @reading

[2020-01-21 22:21] More reading re drought indices.
Compiling references. Brief catch-up w/ Tom. @reading @writing Met with mentor - should help w/ admin.

[2020-01-21 22:23] +continued yesterday's work on drought indices.

[2020-01-22 20:10] More ref compiling on drought indices.
Will probably end this stage ttmrw, w/ 22-3 more key refs and then begin proper writing based on notes and diagrams. Working on 'good enough'. @reading @writing

[2020-01-23 21:37] Bad day, @health freakout.
Will be back on task tmrw.

[2020-01-24 20:00] Reading and notes re Drought Indices done for time being - tomorrow actual writing starts.
Have become aware again that @tropics case and use of CWD not cfully considered yet - brought up by Adriane last meeting when DIs were presented. Since 'basket approach' used, can include CWD at later time. @reading @writing

[2020-01-25 20:45] Sorting out conferences/training events.
Begin setting up new laptop for data analysis. @org

[2020-01-26 22:39] New laptop set-up.
Encountering problems. 
A bit more reading. Bad @health day. Stupid GPs.

[2020-01-27 20:44] Good reading and wrriting day.
Organising pseudo-text, reference set-up for all refs to be used re Drought Indices done. @reading @writing Proper editing begins tmrw.

[2020-01-28 20:56] Pseudo-org and categoried to perfection.
Writing writing writing. some @reading mostly @writing. @health strikes again, but GP knows best...

[2020-01-29 23:37] Writing writing writing - the abstract.
Break from lit rev write-up. @writing @words @what do they mean?

Also had to service my *new* laptop. Fun delays abound.

[2020-01-29 23:37] the poster abstract for Treescapes 2020

[2020-01-30 23:08] writing writing - laptop troubleshooting - writing drought indices + abtract.
@writing Still trying to figure out 'good enough' and better/faster way to distill info.

[2020-01-31 19:11] more writing.
Saw Tom (Hi tOm.) Submitted Treescapes abstract. Began SP for Big Data training application (UoOxf). May have busted both knees? @writing

[2020-02-04 20:06] short day.
Worked on ET part of the write-up. @reading a bit around based on  what we discussed last time. Looking to keep things simple. @writing Day cut short as @health prob was figured out. Should be on track now.

[2020-02-06 20:06] ET is pandora's box.
I've opened it. @writing and @reading for DIs on ET topic. Untangling AED/VPD/PET and confusing nomenclature in literature. Why can't we just agree. Also @health being dealt with

[2020-02-07 22:00] Untangled the ET monster.
Got some excellent help re tropics. Begun final w@writing. Officially stopped @reading. 

For real. Honest. 

Very productive day, 7h + 2 naps only! Amazing.

[2020-02-10 21:57] Didn't manage to work over weekend.
Got more writing done today. Google doc updated. Short day on acc of @health. @writing on ET is going well though. New laptop problems persist - old one having hiccups. Hope to fix them by the time aanalysis comes up. Have finally done more admin re @health evidence for uni. Doing my best to finalise ET tmrw.

[2020-02-11 21:07] 1/3 left on ET.
good @writing day. Updated Google Doc w/ latest write-up. Missing some refs as I am test-driving new laptop and don't have ref manager set up yet. Should now realistically be done with that part tmrw.

[2020-02-12 21:42] average writing day.
@writing Will update google doc tmrw w/ 2 day's worth.

[2020-02-14 01:04] average @writing day.
Admin. google doc wnot updated. 

sleep is for the weak.

on track for Monday wrap-up.

[2020-02-14 21:19] bad @health day.
Will work tmrw instead.

[2020-02-19 20:54] This should add a new entry for today.
@zsh bashing today, using Linux, playing with BlueBEAR. Jobs seem to be going through.

[2020-02-21 18:20] recovering from yesterday's trip to campus.
Should be able to work over the weekend. @health

[2020-02-23 21:35] Admin.
Looking how to use R w/ NETCDF. Documenting briefly major drought events during VOD Ku Band data period (i.e. 1987-2017)

[2020-02-24 23:25] More admin and finished the Oxford appl (first version anyway).
I hate emails.

[2020-02-25 20:31] Fixed RStudio.
NetCDF files seem to be opening fine. Will do as much as I can tmrw before meeting. Plan is to look at 2012 Great Plains drought in CONUS.

[2020-02-27 00:05] Long day of fixing R (again, for good this time), bc of conflicts w/ Anaconda R and that version not letting me install packages??.
Managed to concat ncdf files, fix the time format issue, many issues w/ time format and concat with R, hadad to switch to cmd and use NCO and CDO. No actual analysis done yet. :( 
But a lot of troubleshooting.

[2020-02-28 21:58] Recovery day.
Will work over weekend.

[2020-03-02 22:18] short day due to @health.
On-going prob since last Thurs, but seems to be dying down now (I am choking the prob as we speak, not much life left in it).

Figured out some resolution issues re coding in prep for Fri deadline. Prep prep prep

[2020-03-03 23:46] Victory after meeting w/ Mica today.
Nearly done w/ yearly & montly means prep. Should start time conv and perhaps graphs tmrw. Applied to Bham DR conf. Mental health mentor meeting. Pretty good day cons head was determined to explore. @health @coding

[2020-03-04 22:39] Have finished prepping files but am running into multiple problems with masking.
Weird things are happening -> have tried everything under the sun. Asked for help on nco forum, should get quick response. @health finally easing.

[2020-03-04 22:42] some delay bc of space juggling on my laptop and dealing with RDS connection probs.
Had to redo some steps from yesterday... x(

[2020-03-06 00:04] Masked and plotting en route.
Will try to improve tmrw and add some line plots  as well. Will also try to get anomaly maps/plots. @coding

[2020-03-06 23:41] work work work will now send what plots I managed to make, R has been frustrating...
Too tired to think now

[2020-03-09 21:18] problem with glasses, will be fixed tmrw.
Managed to take care of LoA and get evidence from GP, but can't see much without them. Will continue coding tmrw when they're fixed. @health

[2020-03-12 21:03] Recovered from new anti-depressant hole.
9-12/03/2020 affected, bedridden on the 10th, better on 11th, started working again today, 12 (9 evening was when hell started). Organising code, commenting, README for data folder; plan wht plots/analyses to do next; module choice from Bham; [C

[2020-03-13 22:11] Finished V2 of LoA as per Mica's feedback.
Got yearly anomalies and plots. Also got a fever. @health @coding I sure hope it's not the corvid. No more flu for this year, once is enough, thank you. Will try to work on weekend to make up for bad health week, provided fever doesn't worsen.

I honestly just want to work...

[2020-03-16 21:51] @coding today.
Working on plotting anomalies, showing trends. Half day, due to @pills. Will get new ones tmrw. @health

[2020-03-19 19:59] Switched R coding into PyCharm.
Rstudio was slow and buggy. Now much improved for such large files. Have figured out how best to read and subtract continent polygons from world shape file. Plan to subset raster VOD to polygons and get summary stats, then extend to biomes.

[2020-03-23 19:05] Fixed a coding problem.
Another appeared. But it is progressing. May or may not have solved a @health problem, feeling hopeful productivity will increase. 

Also, f corona.

[2020-03-25 00:36] Ahahaaaa!!!
2 other coding challenges fixed today. I am a master of R (not really, but it is satisfying). Should now have a basis for grouping VOD data using other multipolygon files, e.g. biomes, countries, climate regions, PFT etc. Still need to test on a VOD file w/ time >1

[2020-03-25 21:50] spent today trying to figure out this hypothesis business.
Looking at literature and identifying gaps.

[2020-04-01 21:55] two slow days and one no day bc I've carpal-tunnelled my whole right arm up to my shoulder.
But I managed some plots. It's hard to type tbh, now writing with my left. 

why me

@health

[2020-04-07 21:35] Have forgotten to make the last few entries.
Oops.

R tutorials on LinkedIn learning - surprisingly helpful. Have taken last friday and monday off, to completely rest arm muscles and tendons from Repetitive Strtrain Injury. Today back to work with a deep dive of some key papers for hypothesis development. Still struggling from RSI, but has improved some.

Have taken note of ADHD medication delays due to COrVID-19/20 on the CENTA formm. Details of this will be added to GRS2 (please me to me don't forget)

[2020-06-15 22:13] Code commenting, researching next steps for using forest loss dataset (it's  in a weird format).
Organising reading notes. Figuring out health timeline for GRS2. Qs to ask Matthias.

[2020-06-17 00:17] almost finished processing the extra ESA LC years.
will send tmrw to Matthias  & Luisa

[2020-06-18 00:43] Ran into some problems with wrapping up the ESA LC data.
Haven't managed to iron them out today, although have finished initial and final steps. Something went wrong in the middle. Will work on it tmrw.

[2020-06-19 00:28] Found the problems with the code for the ESA files.
Now it all works. Only need to apply to and finish the rest of the files, and then will share them with Maatthias and Luisa.
