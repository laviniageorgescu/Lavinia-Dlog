Worked on ET part of the write-up. @reading a bit around based on  what we discussed last time. Looking to keep things simple. @writing Day cut short as @health prob was figured out. Should be on track now.

[2020-02-06 20:06] ET is pandora's box.
I've opened it. @writing and @reading for DIs on ET topic. Untangling AED/VPD/PET and confusing nomenclature in literature. Why can't we just agree. Also @health being dealt with

Got some excellent help re tropics. Begun final w@writing. Officially stopped @reading.

Very productive day, 7h + 2 naps only! Amazing.
